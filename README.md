# REVISION

This is a repository of some notes, a mixture of Markdown (GFM) and LaTeX. It was written in [Atom](http://atom.io), and is best viewed in Atom with the [Markdown Preview Plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus) extension.

HTML versions exist that will render correctly when downloaded and viewed in most modern browsers. Due to my atom configuration they will render in browser as light-on-dark (great for late nights) but will print as dark-on-right.
